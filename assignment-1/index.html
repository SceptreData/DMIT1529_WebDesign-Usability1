        Peter Pan is a character created by Scottish novelist and playwright J. M. Barrie. A free spirited and
        mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having
        adventures on the mythical island of Neverland as the leader of the Lost Boys, interacting with fairies,
        pirates, mermaids, Native Americans, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland. In
        addition to two distinct works by Barrie, the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise,
        both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include a 1953 animated film, a 2003 dramatic/live-action
        film, a TV series and many other works.

        <p>
          J. M. Barrie first used Peter Pan as a character in a section of <span class="italic">The Little White
            Bird</span> (1902), an adult novel where he appears as a seven-day-old baby in the chapter entitled Peter
          Pan in Kensington Gardens. Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers, Hodder and Stoughton,
          extracted chapters 13–18 of <span class="italic">The Little White Bird</span> and republished them in 1906
          under the title <span class="italic">Peter Pan </span>in Kensington Gardens, with the addition of
          illustrations by Arthur Rackham.
        </p>

        <p>
          He returned to the character of Peter Pan as the centre of his stage play entitled <span class="italic">Peter
            Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</span>, which premiered on 27 December 1904 in London. Barrie later
          adapted and expanded the play's story line as a novel, published in 1911 as <span class="italic">Peter and
            Wendy.</span>

          <div class="text-left">
            <p>
              Barrie never described Peter's appearance in detail, even in his novel, leaving it to the imagination of
              the reader and the interpretation of anyone adapting the character. In the play, Peter's outfit is made of
              autumn leaves and cobwebs. His name and playing the flute or pipes suggest the mythological character Pan.
              Barrie mentions in Peter and Wendy that Peter Pan still had all his "first teeth". He describes him as a
              beautiful boy with a beautiful smile, "clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that flow from trees".
            </p>

            <p>
              Traditionally, the character has been played on stage by a petite adult woman. In the original productions
              in the UK, Peter Pan's costume was a reddish tunic and dark green tights, such as that worn by Nina
              Boucicault in 1904. This costume is exhibited in Barrie's Birthplace. The similar costume worn by Pauline
              Chase (who played the role from 1906 to 1913) is displayed in the Museum of London. Early editions of
              adaptations of the story also depict a red costume but a green costume (whether or not made of leaves)
              becomes more usual from the 1920s, and more so later after the release of Disney's animated movie.

            <p>
              In the Disney films, Peter wears an outfit that consists of a short-sleeved green tunic and tights
              apparently made of cloth, and a cap with a red feather in it. He has pointed elf-like ears, brown eyes and
              his hair is red. In Hook (1991), the character is played as an adult by Robin Williams, with blue eyes and
              dark brown hair; in flashbacks to him in his youth, his hair is light brown. In this film his ears appear
              pointed only when he is Peter Pan, not as Peter Banning. His Pan attire resembles the Disney outfit (minus
              the cap). In the live-action 2003 Peter Pan film, he is portrayed by Jeremy Sumpter, who has blond hair
              and green eyes. His outfit is made of leaves and vines.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the novel Peter Pan in Scarlet (2006), Geraldine McCaughrean describes him as having blue eyes and
              light hair (or at least any colour lighter than black). In this novel, Never Land has moved on to autumn,
              so Peter wears a tunic of jay feathers and maple leaves. In the Starcatcher stories written by Dave Barry
              and Ridley Pearson, Peter is described with carrot-orange hair and bright blue eyes.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the 2011 TV miniseries Neverland, released by Sky Movies in the UK and SyFy network in the US, Peter
              (played by Charlie Rowe) is portrayed with dark brown hair and eyes. He plays a flute instead of pan
              pipes.

            Personality
          </h3>
          <p>
            Peter is an exaggerated stereotype of a boastful and careless boy. He claims greatness, even when such
            claims are questionable (such as congratulating himself when Wendy re-attaches his shadow). In the play and
            book, Peter symbolizes the selfishness of childhood, and is portrayed as being forgetful and self-centred.
          </p>

          <p>
            Peter has a nonchalant, devil-may-care attitude, and is fearlessly cocky when it comes to putting himself in
            danger. Barrie writes that when Peter thought he was going to die on Marooners' Rock, he felt scared, yet he
            felt only one shudder. With this blithe attitude, he says, "To die will be an awfully big adventure". In the
            play, the unseen and unnamed narrator ponders what might have been if Peter had stayed with Wendy, so that
            his cry might have become, "To live would be an awfully big adventure!", "but he can never quite get the
            hang of it".

          <h3>Age</h3>
          <p>
            J.M. Barrie created his character based on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident the
            day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy. The "boy who wouldn't
            grow up" character has been described as a variety of ages.
          </p>

          <p>In The Little White Bird (1902), he was only seven days old.</p>
          <p>
            Although his age is not stated in Barrie's play (1904) or novel (1911), the book says that he still had all
            his baby teeth. In other ways, the character appears to be older, about 12–13 years old.

            Peter's archetypal quality is his unending youth. In Peter and Wendy, it is explained that Peter must forget
            his own adventures and what he learns about the world in order to stay childlike. The prequels by Barry and
            Pearson attribute Peter's everlasting youth to his exposure to starstuff, a magical substance which has
            fallen to earth.
          </p>

          <p>
            Peter's ability to fly is explained, but inconsistently. In The Little White Bird he is able to fly because
            he is said to be part bird, like all babies. In the play and novel, he teaches the Darling children to fly
            using a combination of "lovely wonderful thoughts" and fairy dust. In Barrie's Dedication to the play Peter
            Pan, The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow up, the author attributes the idea of fairy dust being necessary for flight
            to practical needs:

        </div>

        <aside class="abilities-quote">
          <p>
            ...after the first production I had to add something to the play at the request of parents (who thus showed
            that they thought me the responsible person) about no one being able to fly until the fairy dust had been
            blown on him; so many children having gone home and tried it from their beds and needed surgical attention.

              Peter has an effect on the whole of Neverland and its inhabitants when he is there. Barrie states that
              although Neverland appears different to every child, the island "wakes up" when Peter returns from his
              trip to London. In the chapter "The Mermaids' Lagoon" in the book Peter and Wendy, Barrie writes that
              there is almost nothing that Peter cannot do. He is a skilled swordsman, rivalling even Captain Hook,
              whose hand he cut off in a duel. He has remarkably keen vision and hearing. He is skilled in mimicry,
              copying the voice of Hook, and the tick-tock of the Crocodile.
            </p>

            <p>
              In both Peter Pan and Wendy and Peter Pan in Scarlet, Peter's ability to imagine things into existence is
              noted. This ability is featured more strongly in Peter Pan in Scarlet. He also creates imaginary windows
              and doors as a kind of physical metaphor for ignoring or shunning his companions. He is said to be able to
              feel danger when it is near.

          <div class="abilities-col">
            <p>
              In Peter and Wendy, Barrie states that the Peter Pan legend Mrs Darling heard as a child was that when
              children died, he accompanied them part of the way to their destination so they would not be frightened.
              This is a role similar to the Greek god Hermes as a psychopomp.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the original play, Peter states that no one must ever touch him (though he does not know why). The
              stage directions specify that no one does so throughout the play. Wendy approaches Peter to give him a
              "thimble" (kiss), but is prevented by Tinker Bell.

      <h3 class="center">Cultural allusions</h3>
      <p class="cultural-content center">
        The character's name comes from two sources: Peter Llewelyn Davies, one of the five Llewelyn Davies boys who
        inspired the story, and Pan, a minor deity of Greek mythology who plays pipes to nymphs and is part human and
        part goat. This is referenced in Barrie's works (particularly Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens) where Peter Pan
        plays pipes to the fairies and rides a goat. The god Pan represents Nature or Man's natural state in contrast to
        Civilisation and the effects of upbringing on human behaviour. Peter Pan is a free spirit, being too young to be
        burdened with the effects of education or to have an adult appreciation of moral responsibility. As a
        'betwixt-and-between', who can fly and speak the language of fairies and birds, Peter is part animal and part
        human. According to psychologist Rosalind Ridley, by comparing Peter's behaviour to adults and to other animals,
        Barrie raises many post-Darwinian questions about the origins of human nature and behaviour. As 'the boy who
        wouldn't grow up' Peter exhibits many aspects of the stages of cognitive development seen in children and can be
        regarded as Barrie's memory of himself as a child, being both charmingly childlike and childishly solipsistic.

          Peter Pan ran away from his parents when he was a baby but nothing more is known of them. A younger sibling is

              Peter flew away from his parents as a baby, as told in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens and Peter and
              Wendy. Finding the window closed and seeing a new baby in the house when he returned some time later, he
              believed his parents no longer wanted him and never came back.
            </p>

            <p>
              In Hook, Peter remembers his parents, specifically his mother, who wanted him to grow up and go to the
              best schools in London to become a judge like his father and have a family of his own. After Peter flew
              away to Kensington Gardens, he returned to find his parents had forgotten about him and had another child.

              In Hook, Peter states that the reason he wanted to grow up was to be a father. He met and fell in love
              with Wendy's granddaughter, Moira, which causes him to forsake his immortality and marry her. They have
              two children in the movie, Jack and Maggie. However, he is estranged from both due to his constant
              absences and broken promises, which irritates Moira. His preteen son, Jack, is often frustrated with
              Peter's prolonged absences and turns to Captain Hook for a father figure. His young daughter Maggie
              retains faith in Peter, which helps him and the Lost Boys rescue her and Jack from Hook. Peter retains
              much of his fun self after his final visit to Neverland, which strengthens his relationship with Jack,

                  Wendy is hinted to have romantic feelings for Peter, but cannot be with him because of his inability
                  to love back. In the 2003 film Peter Pan, the feeling is mutual. Captain Hook can only take away
                  Peter's ability to fly by thoughts of Wendy leaving him, growing up, and replacing him with a husband.
                  Wendy saves Peter by giving him her hidden kiss (signifying he is her true love); this gives him the
                  will to live. In the movie Hook, an older Wendy implies that she used to (and perhaps, still does)
                  have feelings for Peter, saying that she was shocked that he did not prevent her wedding day. In the
                  sequel to the 1953 Disney film, Return to Neverland, Peter and a grown-up Wendy are briefly, but
                  happily, reunited after many years and continue to show feelings for each other.

                  In the original novel, Peter later befriends Wendy's daughter Jane (and her subsequent daughter
                  Margaret), and it is implied that this pattern will go on forever. From time to time Peter visits the
                  real world, and befriends children. Wendy Darling, whom he recruited to be his "mother", is the most
                  significant of them; he also brings her brothers John and Michael to Neverland at her request. It is
                  mentioned that Wendy was the only girl who captured his attention.

                  that Peter Pan is a real person after hearing Wendy's passionate narratives about him. During nursery
                  games, it's Michael who plays the role of Peter Pan whom he looks up to.

                described as such. She is kidnapped by the pirates and left to die on Marooners' Rock, but she is
                rescued by Peter. It is hinted later that she may have romantic feelings for Peter but he does not
                return them, as he is completely oblivious of other people's feelings. In the Disney film, Tiger Lily
                shows her gratitude by performing a dance for Peter and kissing him. The kiss makes him turn bright red,
                and makes Wendy jealous of Tiger Lily.

                Tinker Bell, a common fairy who is Peter Pan's best friend and often jealously protective of him. She is
                the friend who helps him in his escapades. As his fairy, Tink’s malicious actions are usually caused by
                her jealousy which leads to the Lost Boys shooting arrows at Wendy (or nearly stoned to death in the
                Disney film), and eventually even reveals Peter’s hideout to Captain Hook, thinking that Wendy will be
                captured rather than Peter. When Tink realizes her serious mistake, she risks her own life by drinking
                the poison Hook has left for Peter (or pushing Hook’s bomb away in Disney's movie). Her extreme loyalty
                and dedication to Peter is everlasting.

                The crocodile (Tick-Tock in the Disney film) is Captain Hook's nemesis. After Peter Pan cut off Captain
                Hook's hand in a fight and threw it into the sea, the crocodile swallowed it and got a taste for Hook.
                It also swallowed a ticking clock, which alerts Hook of its presence.

              Captain Hook
            </h5>
            <p>
              Captain Hook is Peter Pan's arch-enemy, whose right (or left) hand was cut off in a duel. Hook's crew,
              including Smee and Starkey, also consider him a foe. Captain Hook's two principal fears are the sight of
              his own blood (which is supposedly an unnatural colour) and one crocodile. His name plays on the iron hook
              that replaced his hand cut off by Peter Pan and eaten by a saltwater crocodile, which continues to pursue
              Hook.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the 1953 animated film, Hook seeks revenge on Peter Pan for having fed the crocodile his hand, and
              refuses to leave Neverland without satisfaction. Hook is supported by Mr. Smee. After promising Tinker
              Bell 'not to lay a finger (or a hook) on Peter Pan', he lays a bomb in Peter's hideout. At the conclusion
              of the film, Hook is chased by the crocodile into the distance. Walt Disney insisted on keeping Hook
              alive, as he said: "The audience will get to liking Hook, and they don't want to see him killed.” In the
              sequel Return to Never Land, Hook mistakes Wendy's daughter Jane for Wendy, and uses her as bait to lure
              Peter Pan to his death.

              <p>
                Mr. Smee is Captain Hook's boatswain ("bo'sun") and right-hand man in J. M. Barrie's play Peter Pan and
                the novel Peter and Wendy. Mr. Smee is Captain Hook’s direct confidant. Unlike the other pirates, Smee
                is often clumsy and incapable of capturing any of the Lost Boys. Rather than engaging in Hook’s evil
                schemes, Smee finds excitement in bagging loot and treasures.
